## Category Manager
Category manager for Thunderbird contacts, also allows to send an email to all members of a category (category based contact groups).

This add-on scans all contact-cards of the currently selected addressbook, extracts all categories and displays a list inside the Thunderbird addressbook. It allows to rename and to remove a category (changes the category string in all member contact cards).


*Note:* Category Manager 1.xx depended heavily on the SOGo-Connector and could not function without it, which limited its usage. This dependency was removed with Category Manager 2.xx, so category based contact groups can now be used with standard Thunderbird address books as well. If the SOGo-Connector is installed, categories will of course be synchronized with remote CardDAV servers as before.
